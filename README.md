# Text_classification
Text classification using tensorflow and keras
This program includes a text classfication of IMDB movie reviews with positive or negative review based on the content of review
It also classfies the reviews using neural network modelling with one dense layer, with optimizer "Adam" and loss function of "BinaryCrossEntropy"
It gives an accuracy of 87% for test data and would probably give good accuracy score higher than 87% if trained with more layers which is assumed to be future work.
